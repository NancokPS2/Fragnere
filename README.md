# JDungeon3D

JDungeon3D is the 3D single player proof of concept project for https://github.com/jonathaneeckhout/jdungeon.

For now we will keep this project single player for simplicity. This way we can focus more easily on the core gameplay instead of network syncing.

JDungeon did have a good start to make a MORPG game in godot, we proved that the game works on the multiplayer part. However it missed some core concepts as "Fun" and "A goal to play" it was also too complex for some topics making the threshold too high for new people to participate in the project.

What do we want to find out with this poc?
- If 3D is feasible for this project?
- How can we make it fun?
- Can we make easily maps as the 2d tilemap system was one of the difficulties of JDungeon?
- Can we use more the standard proviced high level multiplayer api to make the project simpler?
- Move the things we liked from this poc to the main JDungeon project. 

What are the next things we will focus on with this porject?
- Add a single enemy
- Check if basic meelee combat feels exciting
- Add some AI to enemies (pathfinding ect)
- Create a very basic Awakening Forest + Base Camp
- Create a basic quest
